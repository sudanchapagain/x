a vault of random computer instructions. basically, i had like 15 different
random repos and multiple random scripts on my machine. i hated them as finding
things was a chore, so i deleted few and the rest was squashed and added here.
now everything i need is just here.

public as i had shared few repos with friends and they still need few things.
nothing of value for others exist here.
