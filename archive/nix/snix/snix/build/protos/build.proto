// A BuildRequest describes the request of something to be run on the builder.
// It is distinct from an actual [Build] that has already happened, or might be
// currently ongoing.
//
// A BuildRequest can be seen as a more normalized version of a Derivation
// (parsed from A-Term), "writing out" some of the Nix-internal details about
// how e.g. environment variables in the build are set.
//
// Nix has some impurities when building a Derivation, for example the --cores option
// ends up as an environment variable in the build, that's not part of the ATerm.
//
// As of now, we serialize this into the BuildRequest, so builders can stay dumb.
// This might change in the future.
//
// There's also a big difference when it comes to how inputs are modelled:
//  - Nix only uses store path (strings) to describe the inputs.
//    As store paths can be input-addressed, a certain store path can contain
//    different contents (as not all store paths are binary reproducible).
//    This requires that for every input-addressed input, the builder has access
//    to either the input's deriver (and needs to build it) or else a trusted
//    source for the built input.
//    to upload input-addressed paths, requiring the trusted users concept.
//  - snix-build records a list of snix.castore.v1.Node as inputs.
//    These map from the store path base name to their contents, relieving the
//    builder from having to "trust" any input-addressed paths, contrary to Nix.
//
// While this approach gives a better hermeticity, it has one downside:
// A BuildRequest can only be sent once the contents of all its inputs are known.
//
// As of now, we're okay to accept this, but it prevents uploading an
// entirely-non-IFD subgraph of BuildRequests eagerly.
//
// FUTUREWORK: We might be introducing another way to refer to inputs, to
// support "send all BuildRequest for a nixpkgs eval to a remote builder and put
// the laptop to sleep" usecases later.
