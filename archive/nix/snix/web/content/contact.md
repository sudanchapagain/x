## IRC
Discussion on Snix primarily happens on IRC. We're on the [Hackint][hackint] network.
Feel free to join the `#snix` channel, best through your IRC client or via the
[Webchat][snix-webchat] [^1].

### Bridges to Matrix and XMPP
Hackint also bridges to [XMPP][hackint-xmpp] ([link][snix-xmpp]) and
[Matrix][hackint-matrix] ([link][snix-matrix]), though the bridges sometimes
don't work reliably, which is outside our control.

## Issue tracking
We use the [Issue Tracker][issues] on our [Forgejo Instance][code] to track
issues.
If you want to work on some of these issues, it's best to reach out first, to
make sure noone is already working on this and to exchange ideas on how to solve
it.

## Contributing
Please also check out our [Contribution Guide]({{< ref "/docs/guides/contributing" >}}),
which describes how to send changes.
