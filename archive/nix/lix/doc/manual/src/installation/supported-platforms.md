# Supported Platforms

Lix is currently supported on the following platforms:

  - Linux (i686 (tier 2), x86\_64 (tier 1), aarch64 (tier 1)).

  - macOS (x86\_64 (tier 2 [(issue to make tier 1)](https://git.lix.systems/lix-project/lix/issues/269)), aarch64 (tier 1)).


Tier 2 platforms aren't checked in CI, so may break without notice; such breakage *is* however considered a bug.
We would like for them to work but they are a secondary priority.
