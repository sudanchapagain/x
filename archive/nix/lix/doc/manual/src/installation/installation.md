# Installation

See https://lix.systems/install/ for more details.

<!--

FIXME(Lix): Distributions section is probably good but is definitely outdated as of this writing given nobody has packaged Lix yet (2024-05-05)

## Distributions

The Nix community maintains installers for several distributions.

They can be found in the [`nix-community/nix-installers`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-installers) repository.
